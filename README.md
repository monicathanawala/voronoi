# voronoi
Using Voronoi diagrams to cluster single-molecule localization microscopy data to identify and extract important features.
written by Monica Thanawala, 2016

It is based on the clustering algorithm described as the SR_Tesseler method (Levet et al., Nat Methods 2015).
It is organized to work on multicolor single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data sets saved as binary files.
It is currently written to use two scripts from Zhuang Lab/matlab-storm-master to read in and write binary files that contain the molecule lists.
