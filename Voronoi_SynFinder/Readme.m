% This code identifies clusters in multi-color three-dimensional STORM
% images using Voronoi tesselation in 2 dimensions (x and y).
% The application here is to find synapses in mammalian neurons and brain
% tissue, but it has been applied to other biological problems effectively
% as well.

% VoronoiN: a simplified version to run exclusively on single-color
%   experiments, either alone or taken in series with other color. Can run on N colors. 
% FindNearbyClusters: in progress, used to detect clusters near a certain cluster
